INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
===========================

Welcome to DevBox!

DevBox is a program manager for portable development disks. It allows you to install and run your development tools in a controlled environment you can transport between computers via thumb drives or other external media.

By default, a DevBox-configured drive follows the structure below (you can also make up your own):

root/
- assets/	-- images and other resources
- bin/		-- programs and tools
- plugins/	-- devbox plugins
- src/		-- source code/your repos
- boot.bat	-- devbox boot script

Ideally, you should install DevBox on the bin/devbox folder. The program will automatically generate auxiliary configuration files for your install, and a boot.bat script for your convenience.

Thank you for choosing DevBox!


Please note: DevBox was not designed for running over the network.
